Abstract
Introduction: Prior to 2020 treatment options for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were limited and typically involved long treatment durations and high financial burdens. 
In the eastern European and central Asian (EECA) region, traditional inpatient tuberculosis (TB) care models, alongside high MDR-TB rates, escalates nosocomial transmission risks and treatment costs. 
Modified, fully oral, shorter treatment regimens (mSTR) implemented in the WHO European Region under operational research conditions offered a potential reduction in the burden of MDR-TB treatment for both patients and health systems.

Methods: We conducted the first regional evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the novel mSTR treatment regimen compared to the standard of care (SOC) in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Republic of Moldova. 
We used cohort data on mSTR efficacy and World Health Organisation data on SOC in patients with MDR-TB. We used a Markov model, with treatment costs calculated from the provider perspective. Outcomes were measured 
in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) calculated per QALY gained in each country. An annual 3% discount rate was used for both costs and outcomes.  We performed 
univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to assess the robustness of our cost-effectiveness calculations under varying assumptions. Finally, we estimated potential cost-savings if mSTR was implemented nationally 
and we evaluated different willingness-to-pay thresholds (WTP) based on Wood et al.'s country-level cost-effectiveness thresholds. All costs were reported in 2022 USD.

Results: We estimated that mSTR can reduce TB treatment costs by between 23% a 47% and drug costs by 39% to 74%, compared with SOC in the countries studied. mSTR resulted in cost savings of between $3,596 and $8,174 per patient and 
offered additional health gains of between 0路56 to 2路69 QALYs per patient. mSTR remained cost-effective (ICER< WTP) compared with SOC in 74%, 75%, 88% and 90% of PSA simulations in Belarus, Georgia, Republic of Moldova, and Kazakhstan, 
respectively. Implementing mSTR in up to 80% of MDR/RR-TB patients may result in cost savings of $20路5 million in Kazakhstan and $2路5 million in Belarus, equivalent to 17% and 3% of their national TB budgets, respectively.

Conclusions. Compared with SOC, mSTR is a more cost-effective treatment option for MDR/RR-TB, which should be considered by policymakers in the EECA region. Using insights from current implementations to scale up, plan operational changes, 
and reallocate savings from mSTR could greatly enhance TB services and patient care.
